Burpy v0.1
===========

This portable python tool,parses Burp Suite (http://portswigger.net) log and performs series of tests and finally generate HTML report.

I have included one raw http request manipulation library (rawweb.py).
Using this library you can easily manipulate (Add remove headers , parameter ,change methods) raw http requests on the fly.

You can easily write your own module specific to any web application. 

One example is given below.

Below mentioned burpy module adds a new header to any request, remove Referrer header and csrf token from request and fire the request.
If generic CSRF error is returned, it means token validation is present in server side. If server respond is a different manner it log this crafted request in html report.
