I have included one raw http request manipulation library (rawweb.py) here.
Using this library you can easily manipulate (Add remove headers , parameter ,change methods) raw 
http requests on the fly.

You can easily write your own module specific to any web application. 

One example is given below.

Below mentioned burpy module adds a new header to any request, remove Referrer header and csrf token from 
request and fire the request.If generic CSRF error is returned, it means token validation is present in 
server side. If server respond is a different manner it log this crafted request in html report.

And this is how the final report looks.
